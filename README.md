We've all been there. Come lunch time and we want to go out to get something to eat, but we don't know where. Sure, we could look up some ratings and read some reviews, but we all end up doing the same thing... asking the people around us, where can I get some good food?

Let this app take care of this for you. Whenever you, a friend, classmate, or co-worker go out to eat, take a picture of your food and submit it with the price you paid for it. You'll soon build a collection that you can sort and filter when the time comes. Never wonder what you'll eat and what you'll pay for it again!
